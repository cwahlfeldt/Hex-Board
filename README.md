**Hex-Board**
========================================================================================
__________________________________________________________________________________

This is a turn-based/rouge-like/strategy/"boardgame" game built with unity. The game will feature movement based attacking which will require strategic thinking when moving to different places on the "board". The theme is space and will use "lowpoly" style for modeling to keep thingssimple and I also think it looks good.

To start using this repo either clone or download somewhere onto your computer and import the project into unity (currently using free version). What i do is just click on my scene that is located in the assests folder and it will start the project from there.

feel free to fork if you like.

**Ultimate Todo List:**
=======================================================================================
	
~~Reset tile checker~~ (a little buggy)

~~Change the character movement to something simpler and easier. (See CharController.cs)~~

~~Multiple enemies on board at once~~ (still needs lots of polishing)

~~Graphical representation of health~~

~~Make it so the enemy cannot move to player tile~~ (little on the buggy side but works)

~~Add funtionality to "red tiles" so that the enemy can hurt the player (make an array of all)~~ (very basic)

update pathfinding for enemies to not be able to run onto same tile as player and enemy

Fix when enemies can move after the player has moved (this already kind of works..could be more "turn based")

Multiple Types of enemies e.g. (archer, mage, bomber, berzerker...) this also means different AI behavior for each type

Create upgrades e.g. (uses of longshot, sheild, FTL boosts) that can be found on board during gameplay

Player can toggle a longer shot with a button, to kill something further away from him (by 2 tiles and can be upgraded)

Start Screen

End game

Reset game

Save game (maybe?)

At end of level queue harder level/increase dificulty from stage to stage

Make tiles all the same so that you dont know which tiles to go to (only when prototype is near completion)
