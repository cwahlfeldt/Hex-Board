**Hex-Board**
========================================================================================
__________________________________________________________________________________

This is a turn-based/rouge-like/strategy game built with unity.


**Ultimate Todo List:**
=======================================================================================
	
~~Reset tile checker~~ (a little buggy)

~~Change the character movement to something simpler and easier. (See CharController.cs)~~

Multiple enemies on board at once

~~Graphical representation of health~~

~~Make it so the enemy cannot move to player tile~~ (little on the buggy side but works)

Make tiles all the same so that you dont know which tiles to go to

Fix when enemies can move after the player has moved

Multiple Types of enemies e.g. (archer, mage, bomber, berzerker...) this also means different ai behavior for each type

Create upgrades e.g. (uses of longshot, teleports to other parts of map, sheild, FTL boosts) that can be found on board during gameplay

Player can toggle a longer shot with a button, to kill something further away from him (by 2 tiles)

Start Screen

End game

Reset game

Save game (maybe?)

At end of level queue harder level/increase dificulty from stage to stage
