This is a turn-based/4X...ish game prototype made with unity (free version)
===========================================================================

Todo List:
 	
- Enemy AI : 
 	eventually different types of enemies (example: "ranged" or "melee..")
 	..
 	..
 	..
 	..
 	 		
- Turn-Based System : 
 	 enemy(ies) go after the main player
 	 ..
 	 ..
 	 ..
 	 ..
 	 		
- Upgrades : 
  	ie ("FTL jumps" or "ranged attack boosts")
 	..
  	..
  	..
 	 		
- Galaxy Selector : 
	Creates "levels" (basic diamond map) and a way to access them, will have TIER system for difficulty
 	 ..
 	 ..
 	 ..
 	 ..
 	 		
- more ideas needed?..
